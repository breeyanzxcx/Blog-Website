            <p>The Gilas Pilipinas Men bow out of the 2024 FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup with a pair of dismal blowouts, leaving the undefeated Gilas Women as the sole medal bet in the Easter Sunday playoffs</p>
            
            <p>MANILA, Philippines – The Gilas Pilipinas Men 3×3 will go home empty-handed in the FIBA 3×3 Asia Cup in Singapore after bowing to Japan, 22-12, in the do-or-die pool phase match on Saturday, March 30 </p>

            <p>Losers to undefeated Australia in Pool C games earlier in the day, both teams got off to somewhat of a sluggish start in their winner-take-all derby as Japan held an 8-5 lead at the 6:18 mark that did not 
            change for nearly two minutes in the 10-minute contest. </p>

            <p>Ryuto Yasuoka, however, finally broke the dry spell off a two-pointer with 4:41 to play to double up on Gilas, 10-5, essentially spelling doom for the underdog Filipino squad.</p>
            
            <p>Tomoya Ochiai then drove home the proverbial dagger deuce from the right wing at the 3:41 mark to extend Japan’s gap to 7, 13-6, and never look back. </p>
