            <p>Police say Gretchen Custodio Diez was arrested for going live on Facebook while inside a female restroom</p>
            
            <p>MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A transgender woman who was prevented from using a woman’s restroom in a 
            Cubao mall in Quezon City was arrested on Tuesday, August 13. </p>

            <p>According to two separate desk officers of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD), Gretchen Custodio Diez was 
            arrested for going live on Facebook while inside a female restroom.
                <br>
                <br>
                Diez was prevented from using a women’s restroom by a janitress who insisted that she use the men’s restroom.
                <br>
                <br>
                Diez recorded the incident live on Facebook. She appeared to have been held inside the mall, isolated from other shoppers in a room that had swinging doors. 
                The janitress was recorded as saying that she will file a case against Diez.</p>

            <p>The janitress then said: “May utin ka pa rin. Tandaan mo ‘yan (You still have a penis. Remember that).”
                <br>
                <br>
                Cops earlier said Diez was set to face a complaint for unjust vexation. Hours later, at around 11:30 pm, Diez walked free after the janitress apologized and decided to drop charges against the transgender woman. </p>
            <p>The Philippines is known to be one of the more tolerant countries in the world to the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, 
            bisexual, transgender, and queer) community, but it has yet to pass a bill prohibiting discrimination on the basis 
            of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. </p>
