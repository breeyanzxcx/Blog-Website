            <p>Revilla's staff Richard Cambe died in 2021, leaving only Napoles and the senator to possibly pay the amount</p>
            
            <p>Five years since its split controversial decision to acquit Senator Bong Revilla of plunder, the anti-graft 
            court Sandiganbayan has yet to execute its judgment for the senator and others to return to public coffers the plundered 
            P124 million.</p>

            <p>It turns out that on May 15, 2019, the Sandiganbayan decided that it would hold its execution of the civil liability 
            judgment to give way to the Supreme Court (SC) appeals of those convicted for plunder, Janet Lim Napoles and Revilla’s 
            staff Richard Cambe. The appeals were filed in 2019, or five years ago.</p>

            <p>Although Revilla was acquitted, the Sandiganbayan Special First Division, voting 3-2, still ordered the “accused [to] 
            solidarily and jointly” return the P124.5 million to the national treasury.</p>

            <p>Relationship speculations between the two started in August, when a video of them getting cozy at a party circulated online. The two were 
            also seen leaving several comments on each other’s Instagram posts. </p>
