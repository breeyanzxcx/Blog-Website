            <p>MANILA, Philippines – From the SexBomb Girls to the STREETBOYS, and from the Pop Girls to XLR8, 
            we’ve seen our fair share of P-pop groups over the years. But recently, it seems that P-pop is 
            at the point where it is thriving the most.</p>
            
            <p>In 2021 alone, several P-pop acts made waves not only on the local stage, but also captured the 
            attention of the global scene.</p>

            <p>SB19, for example, made history as the first Filipino act to be nominated under the Billboard Music 
            Awards Top Social Artist category. The five-piece group’s song “Bazinga” has also overtaken BTS’ “Butter” 
            in the Billboard’s Hot Trending Songs chart. (Want to be an A’TIN?: A beginner’s guide to SB19) </p>

            <p>Meanwhile, P-pop group ALAMAT became the fastest OPM act to debut on Billboard’s Next Big Sound Chart. 
            Their debut single “kbye” peaked at the No. 2 spot in the charts within just three weeks of its release. 
            The eight-member boy group is also rising to fame for incorporating seven Filipino languages in their tracks, 
            representing the members’ home provinces.</p>
