            <p>Adamson wins its first-ever UAAP girls' volleyball title in dominant fashion, sweeping Nazareth-NU to complete

            <p>MANILA, Philippines – Adamson continued to stamp its class in the UAAP high school level, as the Baby Falcons 
            denied Nazareth-NU a girls’ volleyball title three-peat bid with a 25-18, 25-18, 28-26 thrashing in Game 2 on Monday, 
            February 12, completing a dominant 14-0 Season 86 sweep.</p>

            <p>Less than a day ago, Adamson had also claimed its first boys’ basketball title in 31 years on Sunday, February 11, 
            also against Nazareth-NU.</p>

            <p>Nineteen-year-old Shaina Nitura shone brightest after the two-game sweep, nabbing both season MVP and Finals MVP honors 
            to cap off her Baby Falcons career.</p>

            <p>Led by Nitura and two other graduating stars, Mary Grace del Moral and Felicity Sagaysay, Adamson not only completed a 
            rare season sweep, but also lost just four sets total in its entire campaign. </p>
