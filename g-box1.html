            <p>MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ very own Gwendolyne Fourniol 
            ended her Miss World journey early after failing to enter the pageant’s first cut or top 40. </p>

            <p>French-Filipina Fourniol represented the pageant-crazy Philippines at the 71st edition of the 
            Miss World pageant. Miss World is one of the “Big 4” pageants in the world, along with Miss Universe, 
            Miss International, and Miss Earth.</p>

            <p>The pageant night was held at Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai, India, on Saturday, March 9, 
            with Megan Young – Miss World 2013 and the Philippines’ only Miss World titleholder – as one of the 
            presenters. Before Fourniol, Tracy Maureen Perez finished in the top 13 in 2022, while Michelle Dee 
            finished in the top 10 in 2019.</p>

            <p>Fourniol was crowned Miss World Philippines and Perez’s successor in June 2022. She clinched the 
            local crown after her second try in the pageant. The French-Filipina stunner first joined in 2021, 
            where she placed in the top 15. </p>
