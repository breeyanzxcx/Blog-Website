            <p>Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani receives a thunderous welcome despite off-field issues in his first home game with the Los Angeles Dodgers</p>
            
            <p>Shohei Ohtani said he was grateful for the warm welcome he received in his first home game in a Dodgers’ uniform and rewarded the sold-out Los 
            Angeles crowd by reaching base three times in a 7-1 win over St. Louis on Thursday (Friday, March 29, Manila time).</p>

            <p>The Japanese was greeted with thunderous applause when he was introduced on a sunny day at Chavez Ravine and repaid the fans with a solid 
            performance that included a single, double and walk.</p>

            <p>“I’m very grateful now to be part of the Dodgers and to be received by the Dodgers fans,” said Ohtani, who joined the club on a record 
            10-year $700 million contract from the Los Angeles Angels in the off-season.</p>

            <p>“Obviously, I’ve been here before as an opponent player so it was a little bit intimidating, but I’m very grateful for the fans, and there 
            were a lot of them.”</p>
