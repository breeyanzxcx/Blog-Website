            <p>Almira says they started their fundraising campaign for their 200 pets because she 'will do 
            anything in a legal way just to provide for our dogs'</p>
            
            <p>MANILA, Philippines – Almira Cercado of P-pop girl group 4th Impact broke her silence on her 
            and her sisters’ controversial dog fundraising issue, appealing to the public to “stop the hate.” </p>

            <p>In late February, the quartet started a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe’s official website on 
            their plan to put up a “farm lot for our 200 Shih Tzu dogs.” In the post, the sisters detailed their 
            journey as fur parents, saying that they were first gifted by their fans with five Shih Tzus. 
            They noted that as their “family of dogs multiplied, so did the need for space and resources.” </p>

            <p>4th Impact also disclosed in their post that they’ve received noise complaints from their neighbors, 
            prompting them to temporarily remove their male dogs from their home. Because of this, the sisters decided 
            to build a “dog haven”, saying it’s their dream to provide a “safe and expensive farm where [their dogs] can 
            live out their days in happiness and form.”</p>

            <p>This campaign caught the ire of netizens, with some calling out the group for being “negligent” and “irresponsible” 
            pet owners for letting their dogs reproduce at that rate. On social media, veterinarians and animal support groups raised 
            sanitary issue concerns about the dogs’ shelter, as well as the harms of backyard breeding and inbreeding. The Philippine 
            Animal Welfare Society also took a swipe at the group, reminding the public to “never, ever let your own pets reproduce” as 
            there are many pets up for adoption. </p>
