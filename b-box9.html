            <p>Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. appoints Isidro Velayo Jr. as officer-in-charge ‘to ensure that operations of the 
            agency will not be affected by this legal development’</p>
            
            <p>MANILA, Philippines – Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. appointed on Wednesday, April 17, Isidro Velayo Jr. as 
            officer-in-charge of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), replacing Demosthenes Escoto, whom the Office of the 
            Ombudsman ordered dismissed after he was found guilty of grave misconduct.</p>

            <p>A statement from the Department of Agriculture said the Ombudsman found Escoto “guilty of grave misconduct in a graft case arising 
            from BFAR procurement of communications equipment in 2018.”</p>

            <p>Escoto was one of the respondents in a graft complaint filed in 2022 over the procurement of P2.09 billion-worth of transceivers 
            from a British company for the implementation of the vessel monitoring system.</p>

            <p>At that time, Escoto was the chairman of the bids and awards committee of BFAR. Among the respondents was former director Eduardo Gongona. </p>
