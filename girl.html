                        <p>MANILA, Philippines – Joshua Garcia got his followers buzzing with dating rumors after posting photos of vlogger Bella Racelis. 
                            On Tuesday, September 6, the actor shared a reel on his separate photography account JG IMAHE. The video featured a compilation of 
                            Bella’s photos in black and white, as well as colored versions, and a short clip of the vlogger walking ahead and laughing. 
                            In the caption, Joshua only mentioned the type of camera he used for the video, but he did tag Bella’s Instagram account in the post.</p>

                            <p>From the SexBomb Girls to the STREETBOYS, and from the Pop Girls to XLR8, we’ve 
                            seen our fair share of P-pop groups over the years. But recently, it seems that P-pop 
                            is at the point where it is thriving the most. In 2021 alone, several P-pop acts made 
                            waves not only on the local stage, but also captured the attention of the global scene. 
                            SB19, for example, made history as the first Filipino act to be nominated under the Billboard 
                            Music Awards Top Social Artist category. The five-piece group’s song “Bazinga” has also overtaken 
                            BTS’ “Butter” in the Billboard’s Hot Trending Songs chart.</p>
