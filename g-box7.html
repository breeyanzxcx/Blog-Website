            <p>Battered by late-season injuries to UAAP MVP Angel Canino and role player Baby Jyne Soreño, women's

            <p>MANILA, Philippines – The La Salle Lady Spikers are now in the thick of twice-to-beat Final Four 
            contention in the UAAP Season 86 women’s volleyball tournament alongside fellow title hunters NU and UST.</p>

            <p>Beneath the facade of an encouraging 10-2 win-loss standings card, however, lies a mounting list of problems 
            for the defending champions, including another untimely injury to opposite hitter Baby Jyne Soreño early in La 
            Salle’s four-set win over Adamson on Wednesday, April 17</p>

            <p>Already missing injured MVP Angel Canino for the third straight contest, which the Lady Spikers won 17-25, 
            25-19, 25-11, 25-22, the battered champions are now bracing for the possibility that Soreño may have dislocated 
            her left shoulder after colliding with a teammate on a dig attempt in the first set.</p>

            <p>Shevana Laput, one of La Salle’s few remaining consistent wingers, remained unfazed, however, as she bared 
            her simple mindset ahead of the Lady Spikers’ last two elimination round games in pursuit of a coveted twice-to-beat 
            berth. </p>
