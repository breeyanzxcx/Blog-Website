            <p>The curly hair movement makes up for the ways the existence of curly-haired women has been invalidated</p>
            
            <p>A few mindless scrolls on TikTok will probably lead you to video of a straightening hair stylist who features 
            humorous transformations and goes by the moniker, “MisHart.” With more than 4 million likes, the content creator 
            made a niche following for home-serviced hair “rebonding” on the video platform.  </p>

            <p>While it invites a light chuckle, for curly-haired girls who’ve experienced being perched in the salon chair 
            for hours, these TikTok videos are sure to give war flashbacks. </p>

            <p>It does not help that the mainstream media were once used to professing a set of beauty standards, putting the label 
            “unconventional” on otherwise normal physical characteristics like being plump, dark-skinned, or having curly hair.</p>

            <p>With today’s focus on diversity, people are now embracing natural beauty and inclusivity. A part of this is the curly 
            movement, which advocates for individuals to embrace their natural curls. The initiative spurred curly communities to navigate 
            and reclaim “unconventional” beauty standards. </p>
