            <p>MANILA, Philippines – Former child actor Jiro Manio sold his Gawad Urian Best Actor Award trophy for his performance in the 2003 film Magnifico. </p>

            <p>While Manio had hoped to sell the trophy for P500,000, Boss Toyo explained that if he were to purchase Manio’s trophy for that price, he would have to consider whether any of his
            buyers would be willing to pay that much for it in the next few years.</p>

            <p>Boss Toyo named P50,000 as a starting price, but the two eventually settled on a final price of P75,000. </p>
