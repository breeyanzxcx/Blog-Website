            <p>Assuming bigger offensive responsibilities, Beau Belga powers Rain or Shine to its fifth straight win in the PBA Philippine Cup</p>
            
            <p>MANILA, Philippines – Scoring isn’t exactly Beau Belga’s strongest suit. </p>

            <p>The 37-year-old veteran, though, has been on an offensive tear in the PBA Philippine Cup as Rain or Shine extended its hot streak by 
            way of a 115-105 victory over NorthPort at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium on Wednesday, April 17.</p>

            <p>Resetting his career-high in scoring for the second time this conference, Belga notched 28 points on top of 13 rebounds, 7 assists, 
            and 2 steals to power the Elasto Painters to their fifth consecutive win after a dismal 0-4 start.</p>

            <p>Belga normed just 11.5 points across those four straight losses before he assumed bigger offensive responsibilities following the 
            knee injury of Keith Datu as he doubled his average to 22.8 points over the last five games.</p>

            <p>“Since Keith got injured, I took it upon myself to be a ball hog. I now take 16 to 17 shots in a game. That is rare in my 15 years 
            in the PBA because I usually take 10 to 11 shots at most,” said Belga in Filipino.</p>
