            <p>When national leaders are misogynists, female opposition candidates are more likely to be belittled, 
            sexualized, and disrespected DATA AND VISUALIZATION.</p>
            
            <p>MANILA, Philippines – It’s a man’s world for the presidential and vice presidential candidates in the 2022 elections. </p>

            <p>Vice President Leni Robredo and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte are the lone female candidates in their respective races. 
            Polls show Robredo currently in second place among presidential candidates. Duterte has been a consistent survey frontrunner 
            among vice presidential bets.</p>

            <p>In the months leading up to election day on May 9, things haven’t been smooth sailing for Robredo. She has a long way to 
            go to catch up with the dictator’s son Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., while other male rivals lagging in the surveys ganged up 
            on her over the supposed efforts of her allies to ask other candidates to withdraw from the race. <br> <br> One male candidate even called Robredo to withdraw herself.</p>

            <p>Online, Robredo has become the top target of disinformation, with false claims seeking to tarnish her reputation. At times, these attacks were laced with misogynistic 
            undertones that aimed to diminish Robredo’s intelligence and competence. <br> <br> After all, sexist critics have been working hard to disprove her statement that “the best man for the job is a woman.”  </p>
