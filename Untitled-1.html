        <p>Jiro Manio sells Gawad Urian trophy for ‘Magnifico’ performance on ‘Pinoy Pawnstars’
            <br>
            <br>
            The award, which Manio won for his performance in the 2003 film 'Magnifico,' is sold to Boss Toyo for P75,000

            <br>
            MANILA, Philippines – Former child actor Jiro Manio sold his Gawad Urian Best Actor Award trophy for his performance in the 2003 film Magnifico.
            In an episode of the YouTube series Pinoy Pawnstars on Tuesday, January 2, Manio showed his Gawad Urian trophy to showrunner Boss Toyo to gauge how much he could sell it for.
            While Manio had hoped to sell the trophy for P500,000, Boss Toyo explained that if he were to purchase Manio’s trophy for that price, he would have to consider whether any of 
            his buyers would be willing to pay that much for it in the next few years.

            <br>
            Boss Toyo named P50,000 as a starting price, but the two eventually settled on a final price of P75,000.
            “No’ng napanood kita, sabi ng utol ko na magtatayo ka raw ng museum. Naisip ko, ‘Sana mapabilang ako do’n sa mga dating artista na nakatanggap ng award,'” Manio told Boss Toyo.
            Boss Toyo also detailed the respect he holds for Manio, who he believes made significant contributions to the Filipino film industry.
